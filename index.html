    <p>[Hello! I’m Hongqing (Ives) Xue, a passionate Statistics and Economics double major at Wake Forest University. With a strong analytical mindset and a keen interest in data science, I specialize in mathematical modeling, biostatistics, statistical analysis, and economic research. My academic journey has been shaped by hands-on research in epidemiological modeling, data analysis under economical subjects, and causal inference. Fluent in English and Chinese, I enjoy working in interdisciplinary environments where data-driven insights can lead to meaningful discoveries.
Beyond academics, I actively engage in leadership roles, including serving as the Outreach Chair of the Wake Forest Chinese Student and Scholar Association (CSSA) at WFU. I am also a member of Chinese Ensemble at WFU (https://music.wfu.edu/ensembles/world-music-ensembles/). I’m always eager to tackle new challenges, optimize analytical models, and contribute to innovative projects in data science, economics, and public health research.]</p>
